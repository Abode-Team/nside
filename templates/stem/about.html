                            Incoming college freshman need to plan ahead. These dedicated, passionate students already have a lot on their plate, and planning for dorm room living is one of these challenges. 
                            <br>Most universities don’t have detailed dorm room layouts, leading to confusion and misinformation about how much space is provided and what students actually need to bring along with them. Virtuality can fix this problem.
                            <br> Through the use of three unique softwares, campus dorm rooms and houses can be scanned resulting in a 3D model applicable in a website as seen below. Students can interact with the model, allowing them to customize their room before moving in. It will inform students of the characteristics and dimensions of the space, giving students enough information to adequately prepare for move-in day.

                            My name is Ben Foltz, and I am a sophmore at the College of Wooster. I have been developing business ideas since I was a child, and I know I was born to be an entrepreneur. My most recent project and the one I am most passionate about is a website for an incoming college freshman to help plan their dorm room space and eliminate difficulty with the process. 
                            <br>I had no idea what to expect entering my freshman year at Wooster, and I found out too late that I couldn’t move the desks in my room. Virtuality will provide a detailed 3D scan of dorm rooms from universities across the country, allowing students to customize their room beforehand and inform them of the dimensions and characteristics of the space. I want to empower students throughout the housing selection process, and I know the Virtuality can help make this process much easier.
