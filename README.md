Documentation for Virtuality. 

Incoming college freshman need to plan ahead. These dedicated, passionate students already have a lot on their plate, and planning for dorm room living is one of these challenges. 
Most universities donâ€™t have detailed dorm room layouts, leading to confusion and misinformation about how much space is provided and what students actually need to bring along with them. Virtuality can fix this problem.
